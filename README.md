# crisiScope
Dashboard that serves as a real-time analysis of the world's condition and news articles relating to natural disasters. Aiming to spread awareness and support efforts made by sharing the news through digestible information via UI and UX.

Future work is yet to integrate more pages and a database to house current and past natural disaster logs, while also pulling news information via APIs. This was done through a web development course with Codepath where I got to choose my own project and learn about the uses of HTML, CSS, and JS.
